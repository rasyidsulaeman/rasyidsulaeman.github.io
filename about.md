Welcome to my Portfolio! Hi Iâ€™m **Rasyid** ðŸ‘‹ , I graduated from University of Indonesia with major in Physics. I previously worked in CoLearn an EdTech company for 2 years as STEM Expert. During my work, I was looking for something that have a meaningful impact and my interest lied more on the application side than just mere theory. That's why I transitioned from STEM background to Data Analyst and Product Management.

To me, working with data and analytical thinking have strengthened my passion in **Data Analyst** and **Product Management**. My ultimate goal is to be able to learn about different businesses and help them make better data-driven decisions.
